## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is configured to run directly in the browser without any build process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```
2.  **Run with a local server:**
    You can use any simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can run the following command from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Provide API Key (Optional):**
    To enable AI motivational tips, you need to provide a Google Gemini API key. This project is currently set up to read it from `process.env.API_KEY`. For local testing, you will need a way to provide this variable to your environment or modify the code in `services/geminiService.ts` temporarily.
